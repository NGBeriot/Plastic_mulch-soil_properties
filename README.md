# Plastic_mulch-soil_properties
  Raw data and script for generating the graphs published in : citation

# Content description
  Raw_Data_Beriot.xlsx<br />
	  contains the measurement for all the parameters. Ring_R contains the measurements done on the ring samples, namely ks, n, pb, FC, WDPT. 
	  Cup_R contains all the measurements done on the air dried loose samples, namely pH, EC, ASI.
  
  SAS_results_Beriot.xlsx<br />
    contains the outcomes of the linear mixed effect model implemented in SASÂ® 9.4.
	  The eight first sheets contain the estimates,	standard Error and associated p-value for the combination of the factors Content*Type*Size (n, pb, ks, FC, WDPT, pH, ASI).
	  The eight next sheets contain the p-value obtained after the pairwise comparison (p.n, p.pb, p.ks, p.FC, p.WDPT, p.pH, p.ASI)

  Plastic_mulch-soil_properties_Analysis.R <br />
	contains the script to perform to: <br />
	  - calculate the estimated bulk density with the measure of porosity and the plastic content<br />
	  - perform the linear regressions between the measured parameters<br />
	  - perform the principal component analysis<br />
	  - plot the estimates for each each parameter and each combination of the factors Content*Type*Size<br />
